## Overview
This graphical application serves as a comprehensive Zoo Management System, providing an intuitive interface for managing various aspects of a zoo. The system is built using CustomTkinter for a visually appealing and customized GUI. It incorporates SQLite3 for efficient and secure data storage.

## Features
- **CustomTkinter GUI:** The application utilizes CustomTkinter, a customized version of the Tkinter library, to create an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface for managing the zoo.
- **SQLite3 Database:** The system employs SQLite3 as the underlying database to store and manage information about animals, staff, exhibits, and other essential zoo-related data.
- **Manage Animals:** Users can add, view, edit, and delete information about the animals in the zoo, including their species, habitat, and feeding details.
- **Staff Management:** The system allows for the management of zoo staff, including their roles, responsibilities, and contact information.
- **Exhibit Tracking:** Users can keep track of different zoo exhibits, their descriptions, and the animals residing in each exhibit.
